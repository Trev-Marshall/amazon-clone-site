# Amazon Clone Application

Hello, there! If you are seeing this now you are either looking for some react amazon examples or you will have me as an employee soon. Either way, the info below will fill you in on what this project is and how to run it!

## What is this?

This was an challenge application I was given to make within 5 days. I finished within 3 and added a couple more features after that. I shot for a more modern look for the application but realized I'm not a designer, but I do hope you like it. The live version of the site is hosted [here](https://clone-c9b74.web.app/). Take a look to see if you are interested in what is inside!

## To Run (below are the basic react directions that come with every react app)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
